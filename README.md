Command Line Calculator

This project is based on C++:
In this command line calculator, the user will be able to provide the inputs and the operation he has to perform on the inputs.
The result will be shown on the command line.

Class Calculator has all the operational functions inside it.

There are four Operations as of now:

1. void on_addition(double num1, double num2);
2. void on_subtraction(double num1, double num2);
3. void on_multiplication(double num1, double num2);
4. void on_division(double num1, double num2);
Can be increased as per the usability.

Calculator object can be used to access the operational functions inside the class.
A do while loop is used to do the operations again without exiting.
Class also contains one fail check if the input supplied by the user is not valid and in case cin fails, it will ask for the input again until the input is valid one.

The Class can be increased for other functional operations of the Calculator also.
