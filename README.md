Command Line Calculator

This project is based on C++:
In this command line calculator, the user will be able to provide the inputs and the operation he has to perform on the inputs.
The result is saved in a pre-defined variable called ans. 

Class Calculator has all the operational funcions inside it.

There are four Operations as of now:
1. add(int &num1, int &num2)
2. subtract(int &num1, int &num2)
3. multiply(int &num1, int &num2)
4. divide(int &num1, int &num2)

All the functions are taking the parameters by reference so that copy of variables can be avoided.

The Calculate function calculates an expression. It uses the saved variables. I have generated code which has declaration of the variables.
